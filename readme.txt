you have to manage a farmers market!

each week you get a few days to prepare for the next market, where you:
- book vendors
- manage stalls
- react to and manage events
- balance budget
- grow the market

on the last day of the week, you have to run the market.

thats all i have for now lol
once i implement the basics ill pick a feature from whatever i write below:

- maybe ill write a narrative
- the market event will have to be more engaging
- maybe the vendors will have stats that level up over time
- stalls could have meta-progression upgrades
